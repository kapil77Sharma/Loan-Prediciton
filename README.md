# Loan-Prediciton
This project focuses on predicting customer loan eligibility using logistic regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm.
By analyzing a dataset containing various customer attributes, we aim to determine whether a customer is likely to be granted a loan or not. 
The project primarily employs logistic regression, a binary classification algorithm, to make these predictions. 
The result is a valuable tool for financial institutions and borrowers to assess the likelihood of loan approval, streamlining the loan application process.

Key Components:

Logistic Regression: Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification to predict loan eligibility.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features to prepare the dataset for model training.
Model Evaluation: Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
